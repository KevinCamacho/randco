        "testimonial": "Raquel has been my hair stylist for more than 15 years.  I’ve had long hair cuts, short hair cuts and everything in between. I’ve had highlights and color. Expectations are always discussed and I have never been disappointed. Nor have the friends and family I have referred. Each and every cut/process is done with extraordinary skill and attention to detail. I would follow her to the salon at the end of the earth if necessary.",
