        testimonial: "Raquel has been my hair stylist for more than 15 years. I’ve had long hair cuts, short hair cuts and everything in between. I’ve had highlights and color. Expectations are always discussed and I have never been disappointed. Nor have the friends and family I have referred. Each and every cut/process is done with extraordinary skill and attention to detail. I would follow her to the salon at the end of the earth if necessary.",

        testimonial: "Katie has been highlighting my hair for the last 4+ years and is truly a master of blonde color! I started carrying around her business cards because I would constantly be asked “who does your color?!” In addition to amazing results, Katie is a fantastic person to chat and have some fun with while sitting for the appointment. She is a true asset to the R&Co team!",
