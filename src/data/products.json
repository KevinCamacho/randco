            "productDescription": "R+Co is a collective of some of the most forward-thinking, rule-bending hairstylists in the business. We are a think tank of top editorial and salon stylists and educators—with a combined century of hairdressing knowledge and experience—and we make sure that we have more than one viewpoint on everything we do.\nR+Co is about an experience. The packaging and fragrances were designed to enhance that experience and evoke a feeling, place, style or attitude. You’ll know just by looking at a bottle or tube what a product is meant to do, and the subtle yet sophisticated fragrances—meant for both men and women.\nOur award-winning line of haircare products feature unique ingredients and benefits designed to deliver immediate, high-performing results while keeping hair and scalp health at top-of-mind. All our formulas are color-safe, heat and UV protective, vegan, cruelty and gluten-free, and without harmful ingredients such as parabens, sulfates (SLS or SLES), mineral oil and petroleum. ",
